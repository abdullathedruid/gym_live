For a fitness-focused application, I'd suggest the following design philosophy:
Color Scheme:
Primary: A strong, energetic color like deep blue (#2563eb) - represents trust, strength, and professionalism
Secondary: A vibrant accent like coral (#f97316) - adds energy and motivation
Supporting colors:
Dark gray (#1f2937) for text
Light gray (#f3f4f6) for backgrounds
White for cards and contrast
Design Principles:
Bold and confident typography
Clean, structured layouts
High contrast for readability
Subtle shadows and elevation for depth
Smooth transitions for interactivity
