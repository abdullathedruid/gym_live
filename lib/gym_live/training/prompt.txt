Can you create a table for various weight-lifting exercises which includes the muscles activated as part of that exercises and the percentage amount of relative involvemen of those muscles.
I would like you to include the following exercises:
Squat
Press
Chins
Pull ups
Face Pulls
Dips
Deadlift
Bench Press
Rows
Curls
Shrugs
Incline Bench Press
Press (Dumbell)
Bench Press (Dumbell)
Incline Bench Press (Dumbell)
Lat pulldown
Chest fly
Tricep extensions


Here is the table with the requested exercises, along with the muscles activated and their relative involvement percentages:

| Exercise | Muscle Involvement (approximate percentage) |
| --- | --- |
| Squat | Quadriceps (60-65), Hamstrings (20-25), Gluteals (10-15), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Press (Barbell) | Deltoids (50-55), Trapezius (30-35), Serratus anterior (10-15), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Chins | Latissimus dorsi (65-70), Biceps brachii (20-25), Trapezius (5-10), Rhomboids (5) |
| Pull-ups | Latissimus dorsi (60-65), Trapezius (15-20), Deltoid (10-15), Rhomboids (5-10) |
| Face Pulls | Trapezius (80-85), Levator scapulae (10-15), Rhomboids (5-10) |
| Dips | Triceps brachii (70-75), Anterior deltoid (15-20), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Deadlift | Erector spinae (40-45), Gluteals (25-30), Hamstrings (15-20), Lower back muscles (10-15), Quads (5-10), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Bench Press | Pectoralis major (60-65), Anterior deltoid (20-25), Trapezius (5-10), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Rows | Latissimus dorsi (50-55), Trapezius (30-35), Rhomboids (15-20), Biceps brachii (5-10) |
| Curls | Biceps brachii (70-75), Brachialis (20-25), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Shrugs | Trapezius (80-85), Levator scapulae (10-15), Rhomboids (5-10) |
| Incline Bench Press | Pectoralis major (65-70), Anterior deltoid (20-25), Trapezius (5-10), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Press (Dumbbell) | Deltoids (50-55), Trapezius (30-35), Serratus anterior (10-15), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Bench Press (Dumbbell) | Pectoralis major (60-65), Anterior deltoid (20-25), Trapezius (5-10), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Incline Bench Press (Dumbbell) | Pectoralis major (65-70), Anterior deltoid (20-25), Trapezius (5-10), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Lat Pulldown | Latissimus dorsi (80-85), Trapezius (10-15), Rhomboids (5-10) |
| Chest Fly | Pectoralis major (70-75), Anterior deltoid (20-25), Core stabilizers (5-10) |
| Tricep Extensions | Triceps brachii (80-85), Anconeus (10-15), Core stabilizers (5-10) |

Note:

* The percentages are approximate and may vary depending on individual factors, such as body positioning, grip strength, and overall lifting technique.
* Some exercises may also engage other smaller muscle groups or stabilizers to varying degrees. These percentages represent the primary muscles involved in each exercise.

Keep in mind that proper form and technique are essential for effectively engaging the target muscles and minimizing the risk of injury when performing these exercises.
